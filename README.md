# Capstone-project

A Jupyter Notebook lab for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate's project

The project is mainly focused on finding out the best possible ways to invest money around Egypt's new megaproject, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM).

The project includes the utilization of web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup, fetching location data via Geopy, getting venue data via Foursquare API, and cluster analysis using k-means algorithm in order to group mueseums with the same demographic of venues around.
